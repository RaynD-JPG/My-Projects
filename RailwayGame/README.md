# RailWay Game

This game was made as a project for my university, it has a few bugs like the game ending not being accurate however I hope that you wil enjoy this game !!!

To win the game you need to make a rail that is connected throughout the entire map you can choose a difficulty between easy and hard and with that you either get a (5x5) Easy or a (7x7) Hard.

## Features
- use right click to place rails
- use left click to rotate the rails
- press with your mouse the end game button when you connected all the rails
